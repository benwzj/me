Born and grown up in China. But moved to Australia according to the spirit. 
The best thing in my world is watching two kid growing up. And it is happening at the moment.


I work as Software Engineer for 12 years in China. But this career paused when I moved to Melbourne. I came back to IT industry at 2020 when Covid19 came in our world. Now I create, deploy, maintain website for all of Australian and the rest of the world.
