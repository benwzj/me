Hey, I'm Ben! I'm a software developer working in Melboune. Welcome to my place on the web for my life, works, projects, sports and anything else I want to show the world. Check out the blog for my tutorials and more.


I was Born and grown up in China. And now moved to Australia according to the spirit. Now I create, deploy, maintain software for all of Australian and the rest of the world.


The best thing in my life is sharing space and time with my two little kids when they are growing up. 

The best thing is happening at the moment :)
