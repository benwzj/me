# OpenID Main Points

- OpenID is based on a simple idea: a user authenticates with an identity provider (IDP), who then provides the user with a unique identifier (called an OpenID). This identifier can then be used to authenticate the user with any website that supports OpenID.
- The OpenID standard provides a framework for the communication that must take place between the identity provider and the OpenID acceptor(relying parties)
- OpenID is decentralized authentication protocol.
- Main purpose is allowing users to authenticate with multiple websites using a single set of credentials, eliminating the need for separate usernames and passwords for each website.

# How to use OpenID

- Users need to create accounts by selecting an OpenID identity provider and then use those accounts to sign onto any website that accepts OpenID authentication.

# OpenID is NOT for authorization, It is just used for Identity authentication. But why?

- Because it donâ€™t want to. Authorization is left to relying parties.
