# In Short

- OAuth(Open Authorization) is a standard for authorization that grants access to Other resources via access tokens.
- OAuth is for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.
- This mechanism is used by big companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter to permit users to share information about their accounts with third-party applications or websites.

# Why OAuth show up

- OAuth began in November 2006 when Blaine Cook was developing the Twitter OpenID implementation. And they concluded that there were no open standards for API access delegation.

# OAuth is not for authentication

- The OAuth 2.0 Framework describes overarching patterns for granting authorization but does not define how to actually perform authentication.
- OAuth is an authorization protocol, rather than an authentication protocol. Using OAuth on its own as an authentication method may be referred to as pseudo-authentication
- This is what pseudo-authentication means:

- For example, when an App, like SelfPrint, sign in using **Social sign-in**, like Google, It is using OAuth. It is Pseudo-Authentication. Gmail provides the tokens that allow SelfPrint to access your Photos.

- Now, OpenID Connect (OIDC) extends the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol for use as an additional authentication protocol. You can use OIDC to enable single sign-on (SSO) between your OAuth-enabled applications by using a security token called an ID token.
