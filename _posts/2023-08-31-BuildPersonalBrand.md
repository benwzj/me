Today I watched a TED talk about 5 steps to build your own personal brand.
I just want to mark it down here!

What is your persoanl brand? **_It is your reputation!_**

How to build your personal brand? I believe the following advices is good one.

# #1 Figure out your goal.

What do you want your personal brand to help you accomplish? Are you change job, or transition into a new industry?
No matter what it is, Write it down, make it specific so that you are working toward to a clear outcome.

# #2 Get Clear on What you want to be known for.

In another word, How do you want other people to describe you as a professional.
No matter what type your professional is, What you need to do is dig deep on What, How and Why behind your work! So that you can make it concrete and **easy to remember**. Just make sure no confusion.
Try to think about this:

- What are the things that make you unique?
- Are there specific talents and expertise you've acquired?
- What do you know more about than most people.

Sit down and make a list!

# #3 Know your Audience.

Who you want to share your personal brand with?
**The reality is, your personal brand is not about you! It is about the people you want to educate with the skills, knowledge and value you provide.**

Who you want to focus on should be based on two things:

- The goal of your personal brand and
- The people who can best benefit from your skills.

Answer this questions:

- Who can most gain benefit from your share? and
- How exactly can you see yourself helping them?

# #4 Creat a Misson statement

Let's pull all your answers into a **single** mission statement that describe:

- Who you are
- What you do
- Who you do it for
- The transformation you create

Let's make a concrete example (Project manager):

> My name is Jennifer, I'm a project manager for a sustainable fashion company. I work with teams across different deparments to plan, organize and direct Annovative marketing campaigns that engage customers while also increasing brand loyalty.

The mission statement can be very different, depending on your career. But no matter what is it, **Write it down and put it somewhere prominent.**
You can use it to make decision about how you speak about yourself when you first meet someone, or to the communities you want to share it with.

# #5 Build your personal brand online

There are two ways to do this online: your own website, and social media.

- Website is very professional!
- Don't choose too many social media!
